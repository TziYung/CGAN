# CGAN
## Using two different approach to train CGAN.
## One use the classic CGAN while the other create an embedding model which apply both in generator and discriminator but only trained while training discriminator.
## mnist_gan_cod is the normal CGAN while mnist_gan_test is the one with one embedding model applied in generator and discrimnator.
